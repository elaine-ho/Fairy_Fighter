Princess!?!
What are you doing?
...
Excuse me miss?
Nothing.
Regardless, you are coming back to the     castle with me!
Not yet.
What? Why?
I'm waiting for my knight in shining armor.
... (Is this girl serious?)
(What should I say?) (Use the arrow keys!)
I can be your knight in shining armor!     Don't be ridiculous!
What are you talking about?
I'm here to save you. That's all.	          I'm obviously a knight...
I see. Well why haven't you said anything?
I'm sorry princess. I must have forgotten.  ...
Whatever. Take me back to my castle.
Right away!				                            Why are you even here?
Let's go!
Here follow me.				                         Sigh...
